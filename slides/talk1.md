- Research Area: Identifying the causes of frustration for Software Developers

# Anthony Elliott
- Hails from Iowa
- 1st year Ph.D. Student

- Research Area: 

# Initial Idea

- As First year Ph.D. Students we want to make the best of our time.
- How about combining our research efforts
- Resulting in: Frustration of Software Developers

# Management Project Proposal 

- Finding literature on what frustrates game developers
- How do these frustrations stunt productivity?
- What is being done to solve them?

# Project Details

- For this project we have to perform an intense literature review
- First we identify 3 seed papers
- From those papers we identify a bank of abou 500+ papers that that relate to that topic.

# Progress Thus Far

 We have been able to identify 3 Papers that we will base our literature review on. 

- Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?
- Six Learning Barriers in End-User Programming Systems
- Game Development: Harder Than You Think

# Challenges
 - Finding papers of relevance to both

The ziffness of dorkies must:

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee


# Some more stuff#

As shown here:

- z-ness has large variance [@item1; @item2].
- x is symmetric to y  [@item3, pp. 33-35]
- as predicted by theory [@item1]


# During the week

This is how we roll

# Conclusion

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=5}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$
