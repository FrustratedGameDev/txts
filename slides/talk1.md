The ziffness of dorkies must:

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

# In the evening

As shown here:

<img align=right src="../img/plot/plot1.png">

- z-ness has large variance [@item1; @item2].
- x is symmetric to y  [@item3, pp. 33-35]
- as predicted by theory [@item1]


# During the week

This is how we roll

rolling ![all the dat](../img/dot/dot1.png)

# Conclusion

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$

# References
 - Can be listed
