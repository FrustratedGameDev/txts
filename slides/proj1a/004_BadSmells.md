# Bad Smells

* Labels are applied and immediately removed from an issue
* A milestone has no issues or few issues
* A milestone was deleted (not able to finish the work in time?)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for the entire project (obviously something wrong here)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for a portion of the project but not the entire project (maybe something was wrong but they resolved the issue. Still may have caused problems)
* If following a numerical process with labels, it is bad if issues skip any of the steps
