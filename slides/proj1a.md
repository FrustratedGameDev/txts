#Here is the 2nd slide

- list of things
- this slide comes after the title

# Milestones

* Outline -- we want to have an outline of our paper done by March 20. Lists sections and main goals of each section.
* Finalize repertory grid for paper comparison by March 21. Requires reading through all papers and identifying dimensions.
* Full paper draft by March 28. Must have full content for every section but does not need to be polished.
* Finalize and submit paper by March 31

# Bad Smells

* Labels are applied and immediately removed from an issue
* A milestone has no issues or few issues
* A milestone was deleted (not able to finish the work in time?)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for the entire project (obviously something wrong here)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for a portion of the project but not the entire project (maybe something was wrong but they resolved the issue. Still may have caused problems)
* If following a numerical process with labels, it is bad if issues skip any of the steps
