# Initial Idea

- As First year Ph.D. Students we want to make the best of our time.
- How about combining our research efforts
- Resulting in: Frustration of Software Developers

# Management Project Proposal 

- Finding literature on what frustrates game developers
- How do these frustrations stunt productivity?
- What is being done to solve them?

# Project Details

- For this project we have to perform an intense literature review
- First we identify 3 seed papers
- From those papers we identify a bank of abou 500+ papers that that relate to that topic.

# Progress Thus Far

 We have been able to identify 3 Papers that we will base our literature review on. 

- Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?
- Six Learning Barriers in End-User Programming Systems
- Game Development: Harder Than You Think

# Paper 1
Title: Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?

Authors: Emerson Murphy-Hill, Thomas Zimmermann, and Nachiappan Nagappan

ICSE 2014

Video games make up an important part of the software industry, yet the software engineering community rarely studies video games. This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, cowboy coders are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.

# Paper 2
Title: Six Learning Barriers in End-User Programming Systems

Authors: Andrew J. Ko, Brad A. Myers, and Htet Htet Aung

VL/HCC 2004

As programming skills increase in demand and utility, the learnability of end-user programming systems is of utmost importance. However, research on learning barriers in programming systems has primarily focused on languages, overlooking potential barriers in the environment and accompanying libraries. To address this, a study of beginning programmers learning Visual Basic.NET was performed. This identified six types of barriers: design, selection, coordination, use, understanding, and information. These barriers inspire a new metaphor of computation, which provides a more learner-centric view of programming system design


# Paper 3
Title: Game Development: Harder Than You Think

Author: Jonathon Blow

The hardest part of making a game has always been the engineering. In times past, game engineering was mainly about low-level optimization - writing code that would run quickly on the target computer, leveraging clever little tricks whenever possible.

- Eat eggs
- Drink coffee

- z-ness has large variance [@item1; @item2].
- x is symmetric to y  [@item3, pp. 33-35]
- as predicted by theory [@item1]

# Conclusion

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=5}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$
