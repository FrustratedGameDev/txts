# What did the Management Track people have to do?

* The goal of this project is to identify and compare General Software Developement to Games Development.
* To do this we found problems, approaches, contributions, related work that discussed distinctive characteristics about both.
* The recommended way to do connect all papers under some common themes was to use a Repertory Grid Analysis.
* Repertory Grid Analysis - uses factor analysis to determine interpretations of an item.

* Factors included papers that discussed Software Development in the games industry

# Repertory Grid Analysis

* Repertory Grid Analysis - uses factor analysis to determine interpretations of an item.

* Each row of this grid identifies a dimension that was found while reading the papers.
	* A dimension was only added if it added value to the dataset already available.
* Each column identifies an attribute which in this case is the names of the relevant papers.

# Project Goals

* Find literature on what frustrates game developers
* How do these frustrations stunt productivity?
* What is being done to solve them?


# Project Details

* For this project we have to perform an intense literature review
* First we identify 3 seed papers
* From those papers we identify a bank of about 500+ papers that that relate to that topic.

#Relevancy Rules 

* In order to find articles a list of relevancy rules were determined:

* These rules were used as guidelines to determine what belonged in our repository

# Key Papers

We have been identified 4 papers to be our key articles for our literature review.

* Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?
* Game Development: Harder Than You Think
* Idea Creation, Constructivism and Evolution
* The 'Console Ship is Sinking' and What this Means for Indies

# Test Procedure

* Relevant papers are collected in one spot
* Repertory grid exists and is in GitHub repo
* Repertory grid has lots of dimensions and papers
* Process is documented using GitHub labels
* GitHub milestones are used to track at least some progress

#Issue Labels

* In our github repo we used a set of tags to identify what stage we were in for the literature review as it relates to that paper.

# Milestones

* Identify key articles -- FINISHED
* Identify relevant articles referenced in key articles -- FINISHED
* Create first version of repertory grid -- FINISHED
* Outline -- we want to have an outline of our paper done by March 20. Lists sections and main goals of each section.
* Finalize repertory grid for paper comparison by March 21. Requires reading through all papers and identifying dimensions.
* Full paper draft by March 28. Must have full content for every section but does not need to be polished.
* Finalize and submit paper by March 31

#Project Progress

* During this first stage we have generated 2 grids with an online tool:
* This first indicates the comparison of our seed papers

#Project Progress 
 
* The second grid demonstrates the comparison found between Software Developers and Game Developers

* Since these diagrams have been created the first grid has expanded as our literature review has spread.
* We will revisit the comparison of the developer grid upon the end of the project.


# Bad Smells

* Labels are applied and immediately removed from an issue
* A milestone has no issues or few issues
* A milestone was deleted (not able to finish the work in time?)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for the entire project (obviously something wrong here)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for a portion of the project but not the entire project (maybe something was wrong but they resolved the issue. Still may have caused problems)
* If following a numerical process with labels, it is bad if issues skip any of the steps
