#Management Track

- Repertory Grid Analysis - uses factor analysis to determine interpretations of an item.

- Factors included papers that discussed Software Development in the games industry

# Project Goals

- Find literature on what frustrates game developers
- How do these frustrations stunt productivity?
- What is being done to solve them?


# Project Details

- For this project we have to perform an intense literature review
- First we identify 3 seed papers
- From those papers we identify a bank of about 500+ papers that that relate to that topic.

#Relevancy Rules 

- In order to find articles a list of relevancy rules were determined:

# Key Papers

We have been able to identify 4 papers that we will base our literature review on. 

- Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?
- Game Development: Harder Than You Think
- Idea Creation, Constructivism and Evolution
- The 'Console Ship is Sinking' and What this Means for Indies

# Test Procedure

* Relevant papers are collected in one spot
* Repertory grid exists and is in GitHub repo
* Repertory grid has lots of dimensions and papers
* Process is documented using GitHub labels
* GitHub milestones are used to track at least some progress

#Issue Labels

- In our github repo we used a set of tags to identify what stage we were in for the literature review as it relates to that paper.

# Milestones

* Identify key articles -- FINISHED
* Identify relevant articles referenced in key articles -- FINISHED
* Create first version of repertory grid -- FINISHED
* Outline -- we want to have an outline of our paper done by March 20. Lists sections and main goals of each section.
* Finalize repertory grid for paper comparison by March 21. Requires reading through all papers and identifying dimensions.
* Full paper draft by March 28. Must have full content for every section but does not need to be polished.
* Finalize and submit paper by March 31

#Project Progress

- During this first stage we have generated 2 grids with an online tool:

- This first indicates the comparison of our seed papers

- The second grid demonstrates the comparison found between Software Developers and Game Developers

- Since these diagrams have been created the first grid has expanded as our literature review has spread.
- We will revisit the comparison of the developer grid upon the end of the project.


# Bad Smells

* Labels are applied and immediately removed from an issue
* A milestone has no issues or few issues
* A milestone was deleted (not able to finish the work in time?)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for the entire project (obviously something wrong here)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for a portion of the project but not the entire project (maybe something was wrong but they resolved the issue. Still may have caused problems)
* If following a numerical process with labels, it is bad if issues skip any of the steps
