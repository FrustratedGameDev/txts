% The Frustrated Game Developer

% April 9, 2015

# Project Goals

* Find literature on what frustrates game developers
* How do these frustrations stunt productivity?
* What is being done to solve them?

# What did the Management Track people have to do?

* The goal of this project is to identify and compare General Software Developement to Games Development.
* To do this we found problems, approaches, contributions, related work that discussed distinctive characteristics about both.
* The recommended way to do connect all papers under some common themes was to use a Repertory Grid Analysis.
* Repertory Grid Analysis - uses factor analysis to determine interpretations of an item.


<img align="center" src="../img/repgrid.png" alt="Picture of repgrid">

* Factors included papers that discussed Software Development in the games industry

# Motivation
* We wanted better understanding of this area
* Current work lacking on qualitative lifestyle
* Where should future research efforts be applied?

# Literature Review
* Collect lots of relevant papers
* Determine the important papers
* Read
* Analyze

# Repertory Grid Analysis

* Repertory Grid Analysis - uses factor analysis to determine interpretations of an item.

* Each row of this grid identifies a dimension that was found while reading the papers.
	* A dimension was only added if it added value to the dataset already available.
* Each column identifies an attribute which in this case is the names of the relevant papers.

# Methodology

1. Determine seed papers
2. Determine relevant papers
3. Extract dimensions
4. Define key articles

# 1: Seed Papers
List them here

# 2: Determine relevant papers
We used the following relevancy rules:

1. Does the paper discuss the development process?
2. Does the paper discuss game development?
3. Does the paper discuss some form of the challenges or stress encountered by developers?
4. Does the paper provide results of some form?

#Relevancy Rules 

* In order to find articles a list of relevancy rules were determined:

<img align=center src="../img/theprocess.png">

* These rules were used as guidelines to determine what belonged in our repository

# 3: Extract dimensions
* Read abstracts
* Read in depth
* What happened if no dimension was extracted?

# 4: Key Papers

These papers were extremely important. We reviewed the references of all of these papers.

* Cowboys, Ankle Sprains, and Keepers of Quality: How Is Video Game Development Different from Software Development?
* Game Development: Harder Than You Think
* The 'Console Ship is Sinking' and What this Means for Indies
* International Game Developers Association. (2004). Quality of life white paper

# Test Procedure

* Relevant papers are collected in one spot
* Repertory grid exists and is in GitHub repo
* Repertory grid has lots of dimensions and papers
* Process is documented using GitHub labels
* GitHub milestones are used to track at least some progress

#Issue Labels
0. Determine if relevant
1. Relevant Paper
2. Summarize
3. Adds Dimension
4. Dimesion added to grid

* In our github repo we used a set of tags to identify what stage we were in for the literature review as it relates to that paper.

# Grid Iterations - Stage 1


# Grid Interactions - Stage 2

# Grid Interactions - Stage 3

# Dimensions Defined

	Requirement Volatility: 
	Requirement volatility describes how often the requirements of a project change. 

	Quality of Life: 
	This dimension outlines the general lifestyle of developers. The pressures of crunch while on the job, maintaining a stable job, and the desire to remain at the company all can be encompassed into the quality of life in this career.

	Creativity: 
	Creativity refers to the encouragement of developers to start from scratch with a project versus building on top of a current codebase. 

	Developer Motivation:

   	With every profession there are certain aspects that draw interest. 
   

# Dimension Defined (cont.)

* User Interactions

   The interactions of the users of the product can change the approach of how the product is approached. 

* Work Ownership
      
   As a developer, it feels good to be acknowledged for the hardwork, responsibility, and accountability that is put into a product. 
   
* Testing
 
   During the process of the literature review it was found that there are circumstances where products have little to no documented testing strategy. 

* Team composition

   There are many aspects of a team that are covered in this dimension: (1) the variation of interactions between the team, (2) the viscosity , and (3) the number of projects a team may handle. These apects of a team have been defined on a spectrum of being dynamic to static. 

* Autonomy for Funding

   The traditional funding source for projects has been funding from venture captilalists and other investors who are intersted in receiving some return from the product such as being a valued stakeholder of the company. 

# Discussion
Put content from Discussion section in paper here

Will likely want to replace our following progress report with more interesting content from the paper.
Will want to consider how much time we have to present.

# Milestones

* Identify key articles -- FINISHED
* Identify relevant articles referenced in key articles -- FINISHED
* Create first version of repertory grid -- FINISHED
* Outline -- we want to have an outline of our paper done by March 20. Lists sections and main goals of each section. - FINISHED
* Finalize repertory grid for paper comparison by March 21. Requires reading through all papers and identifying dimensions. - FINISHED
* Full paper draft by March 28. Must have full content for every section but does not need to be polished. - FINISHED
* Finalize and submit paper by March 31 - FINISHED

#Project Progress

* During this first stage we have generated 2 grids with an online tool:
* This first indicates the comparison of our seed papers

<img align=center src="../img/CSC510Grid1.png">

#Project Progress 
 
* The second grid demonstrates the comparison found between Software Developers and Game Developers

<img align=center src="../img/CSC510Grid2.png">

* Since these diagrams have been created the first grid has expanded as our literature review has spread.
* We will revisit the comparison of the developer grid upon the end of the project.


# Bad Smells

* Labels are applied and immediately removed from an issue
* A milestone has no issues or few issues
* A milestone was deleted (not able to finish the work in time?)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for the entire project (obviously something wrong here)
* One person dominated GitHub contributions for a portion of the project but not the entire project (maybe something was wrong but they resolved the issue. Still may have caused problems)
* If following a numerical process with labels, it is bad if issues skip any of the steps
